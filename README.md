## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It structures content on the web by using a system of tags and attributes.

### History of HTML

HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 and has evolved over time. Various versions of HTML have been released, with HTML5 being the latest and most widely used version.

### Importance of HTML in Web Development

HTML forms the backbone of web development. It provides the structure for web pages, allowing content to be displayed and organized effectively across different browsers and devices.

### HTML Versions and Standards

HTML has undergone several revisions and updates. Some notable versions include HTML4, XHTML, and the current standard, HTML5.

## HTML Basics <a name="html-basics"></a>

### HTML Document Structure

A typical HTML document consists of several elements, including `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. These elements define the structure and metadata of the document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML Elements and Tags

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. They are enclosed in opening and closing tags and can contain text, other elements, or both.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### HTML Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are included within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and value pair.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

### Nesting and Closing Tags

HTML elements can be nested within one another to create hierarchical structures. Each nested element must have an opening and closing tag.

```html
<div>
    <p>This paragraph is nested inside a div element.</p>
</div>
```

### HTML Comments

HTML comments are used to add notes or annotations within the code. They are not displayed on the web page and are only visible in the source code.

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

---

## Text Elements <a name="text-elements"></a>

### Headings (h1 to h6)

Headings are used to define the hierarchical structure of a document. They range from `<h1>` (the most important) to `<h6>` (the least important).

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
```

### Paragraphs (p)

Paragraphs are used to group blocks of text together. They are enclosed within `<p>` tags.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### Formatting Elements

HTML provides various formatting elements for styling text, including `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<em>`, `<small>`, `<sub>`, and `<sup>`.

```html
<p><strong>Bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text</p>
```

### Semantic Elements

Semantic elements provide meaning to the content they enclose. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

```html
<header>
    <h1>Website Header</h1>
</header>
```

### Lists

HTML supports ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, as well as definition lists (`<dl>`).

```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

### Links (a)

Links are used to navigate between web pages. They are created using the `<a>` element and the `href` attribute.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

---

## Multimedia and Embedding <a name="multimedia-and-embedding"></a>

### Images (img)

Images are inserted into web pages using the `<img>` element. The `src` attribute specifies the image file's URL.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

### Video (video)

Videos can be embedded in web pages using the `<video>` element. The `src` attribute specifies the video file's URL.

```html
<video src="video.mp4" controls></video>
```

### Audio (audio)

Audio files can be included in web pages using the `<audio>` element. The `src` attribute specifies the audio file's URL.

```html
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls></audio>
```

### Object (object) and Embed (embed)

The `<object>` and `<embed>` elements are used to embed multimedia content, such as Flash animations or interactive elements.

```html
<object data="flash.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></object>
```

### iframes

iframes are used to embed another HTML document within the current document. They are often used for embedding maps, videos, or other external content.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d171284">
```

## Tables <a name="tables"></a>

### Table Structure

Tables are created using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements. `<tr>` defines a row, `<th>` defines a header cell, and `<td>` defines a data cell.

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>25</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

### Table Attributes

Tables can have attributes like `colspan` and `rowspan` to define the span of table cells across multiple rows or columns.

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Name and Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">John</td>
        <td>25</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

### Table Styling

Tables can be divided into sections using `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` for better organization and styling.

```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr

>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>25</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

## Forms <a name="forms"></a>

### Form Structure

Forms are created using the `<form>` element. Inputs, buttons, and other form controls are enclosed within the form tags.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Input Types

HTML supports various input types, including text, password, checkbox, radio, submit, reset, and more.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
<input type="checkbox" id="agree" name="agree">
<input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
```

### Form Controls

Form controls like `<label>`, `<button>`, and `<textarea>` are used to enhance the usability and accessibility of forms.

```html
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">
<textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### Form Attributes

Form attributes like `action` and `method` specify where and how form data should be submitted.

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <!-- Form controls here -->
</form>
```

## HTML5 Semantic and Structure Elements <a name="html5-semantic-and-structure-elements"></a>

### Header, nav, section, article, aside, footer

HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to improve document structure and accessibility.

```html
<header>
    <h1>Website Header</h1>
</header>
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
<section>
    <h2>Section Title</h2>
    <p>Section content goes here.</p>
</section>
<article>
    <h3>Article Title</h3>
    <p>Article content goes here.</p>
</article>
<aside>
    <h4>Aside Title</h4>
    <p>Aside content goes here.</p>
</aside>
<footer>
    <p>Website Footer</p>
</footer>
```

### Figure, figcaption

The `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements are used to encapsulate self-contained content, such as images, diagrams, or charts, with optional captions.

```html
<figure>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
    <figcaption>Figure caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Time, mark, wbr, main, etc.

HTML5 introduced additional semantic and structural elements like `<time>` for representing dates and times, `<mark>` for highlighting text, `<wbr>` for word breaks, and `<main>` for the main content of a document.

```html
<time datetime="2024-02-24">February 24, 2024</time>
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
<wbr>Word<br>Break
<main>
    <h1>Main Content</h1>
</main>
```

## HTML5 Media and Graphics <a name="html5-media-and-graphics"></a>

### Canvas

The `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, animations, or other visualizations using JavaScript.

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

### SVG

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. It can be embedded directly into HTML.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

### Media Capture

HTML5 introduced the ability to capture audio and video directly from the user's device using the `<input>` element with the `accept` attribute set to "audio/*" or "video/*".

```html
<input type="file" accept="audio/*">
<input type="file" accept="video/*">
```
